## DESCRIPTION

**jellyfin-stuff** is a collection of various shell scripts, css and configuration files which help to customize the Jellyfin front-end interface and automate any other tasks not covered by the official plugins.


Be aware **scripts in this repo modify relevant Jellyfin front-end files** (html, js, css, etc) directly as there is no other easy way to accomplish the objective so use at your own risk. I have done my best to add descriptive comments explaining what is being done if it is not obvious.
