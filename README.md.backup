jellyfin-stuff - This repo contains any relevant files used within the scope of Jellyfin customization and management, while typically steering away from any internal development modifications (C#).


## DESCRIPTION

**jellyfin-stuff** is a collection of various shell scripts, css and configuration files which help to customize the Jellyfin interface and automate any other tasks not covered by the official plugins.

**Be advised that some shell scripts modify the Jellyfin web interface javascript and html files directly as there is no other easy way to accomplish the relevant objectives.
